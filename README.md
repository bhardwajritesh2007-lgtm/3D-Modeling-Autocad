# 3D Assignment – Presspull, Union, Subtract, Intersect

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a *3D AutoCAD assignment* focused on converting a *2D residential floor plan* into a *3D model* using essential solid modeling commands.  
The assignment demonstrates the practical application of *Presspull, Union, Subtract, and Intersect* commands along with materials and visual styles.

---

## 🛠 Software Used
- *AutoCAD*

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand 2D to 3D conversion in AutoCAD  
- To apply solid editing commands effectively  
- To create a basic 3D building model with materials

## 📐 Assignment Workflow

### 1️⃣ Create 2D Plan
- Draw the 2D floor plan as per given dimensions
- Use standard drafting tools like:
  - LINE
  - OFFSET
  - TRIM
  - EXTEND

### 2️⃣ Create Doors & Windows
- Draw doors and windows in the 2D plan
- Use *BLOCK* command for reusable elements

---

### 3️⃣ Add Blocks
- Insert furniture and fixtures using predefined blocks
- Ensure proper scaling and placement

---

### 4️⃣ Change Visual Style
- Switch to *3D Modeling workspace*
- Apply visual styles such as:
  - Conceptual
  - Realistic
  - Shaded with edges

---

### 5️⃣ Convert 2D to 3D
- Use *PRESSPULL* to extrude walls
- Apply solid modeling commands:
  - *UNION* – to combine solids
  - *SUBTRACT* – to create doors and window openings
  - *INTERSECT* – where required for solid intersections

---

### 6️⃣ Add Materials
- Apply materials to:
  - Walls
  - Floors
  - Doors & Windows
- Use *MATERIALS* and *RENDER* tools for better visualization<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-04 222600" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6ad259c-3305-4c35-a1f8-9a0a2861b6ed" />
